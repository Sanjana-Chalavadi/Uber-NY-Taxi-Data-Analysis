# Uber-NY-Taxi-Data-Analysis

# Project Overview

This project addresses the challenges associated with Uber trip supply and demand dynamics in New York City. It analyzes trip data across different times of the day and locations to identify and solve issues, with the primary goal of providing surge leads based on demand patterns. This enhances the efficiency of taxi dispatching and reduces wait times for both drivers and passengers.
